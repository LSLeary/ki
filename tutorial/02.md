# Tutorial 2

In this tutorial, we'll learn about the primary abstraction in `ki`: the **scope**.

Let's get our import out of the way.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE BlockArguments #-}
module Tutorial02 where
import qualified Ki
```

Now, let's look at the type of `scoped`, which is how a **scope** gets introduced and eliminated.

```haskell ignore
scoped :: Context => (Scope -> IO a) -> IO a
```

As you can see, it requires an implicit **context**. That's okay, we learned how to introduce the global
**context** in [tutorial 1](01.md): just call `global`.

`scoped` also takes a continuation, to which it provides a fresh **scope** derived from the **context**. The
**scope** is only _open_ during the continuation, and is permanently _closed_ after the continuation returns. You can
try smuggling the **scope** out via a mutable variable, or just return it directly from the continuation, but there's no
point: attempting to use a _closed_ **scope** is an error, and will throw an exception.

Let's try creating a **scope**, and while it's open, print a message.

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  Ki.global do
    Ki.scoped \scope ->
      putStrLn "Hello, while a scope is open!"
```

Great! How about opening a second **scope** inside the first?

```haskell
  Ki.global do
    Ki.scoped \scope1 -> do
      putStrLn "Hello, while a scope is open!"

      Ki.scoped \scope2 ->
        putStrLn "Hello, while two scopes are open!"

      putStrLn "Back to only one!"
```

What was the point of that? Well, nothing yet, but read on :)
