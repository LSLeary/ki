description:
  A lightweight, structured concurrency library.

  This package comes in two variants:

  * "Ki" exposes the most stripped-down variant; start here.

  * "Ki.Implicit" extends "Ki" with an implicit context that's used to
    propagate soft cancellation signals.

      Using this variant comes at a cost:

        * You must manually add constraints to propagate the implicit context to
          where it's needed.

        * To remain warning-free, you must delete the implicit context constraints
          where they are no longer needed.

    If you don't need soft-cancellation, there is no benefit to using this
    variant, and you should stick with "Ki".

  Because you'll only ever need one variant at a time, I recommend using a
  <https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html#pkg-field-mixins mixin stanza>
  to rename one module to @Ki@ while hiding the others. This also simplifies the
  process of upgrading from "Ki.Implicit" to "Ki" if necessary.
